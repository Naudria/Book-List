## Description

Book List is a simple CRUD, MVC Sinatra app that allows the user to add to a master list of favorite books—including the book's title, author and genre—and share them with other users. A user can:

1. Sign up for a new account
2. Log in to her account
3. See an index of books added by all users
4. View any book's info
5. View a list of Genres
6. View a list of books within each Genre
7. Edit the book's info only if she created the book
8. Add new books to the index
9. Delete a book only if she created the book
