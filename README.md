Book List is a simple CRUD, MVC Sinatra app that allows the user to add to a master list of favorite books—including the book's title, author and genre—and share them with other users. A user can:

1. Sign up for a new account
2. Log in to her account
3. See an index of books added by all users
4. View any book's info
5. Edit the book's info only if she created the book
6. Add new books to the index
7. Delete a book only if she created the book
